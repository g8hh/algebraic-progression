        `Welcome to the Algebraic Progression Textbook! This tab serves as an in-game guide that updates as you progress throughout the game.<br><br>
        Algebraic Progression is an incremental game where the goal is to get all of the Achievements and win the game. The game's mechanics<br>
        are inspired by various aspects of algebra in mathematics, however most mechanics do not faithfully represent how they actually work.<br>
        The game also features common incremental game mechanics, such as Upgrades, Challenges, Buildings, Automation, and Milestones.<br><br>
        Each section afterward covers every important mechanic in the game that may require explaining. There are a few things that you should<br>
        know before your start your journey:<br><br>
        <b>1)</b> While there are some idle sections, this game is active and grindy.<br>
        <b>2)</b> This game has offline progress! This means that resources keep producing while you're away. Use this to your advantage.<br>
        <b>3)</b> If you ever feel stuck, keep waiting and grinding, or ask for help on the Discord server. (linked in the Options tab)<br>
        <b>4)</b> Before you complain about something not having very many uses or ask for a QoL mechanic, it might already be in the game,<br>
        but is unlocked later.<br>
        <b>5)</b> There may still be things that need to be polished. Don't be scared if you encounter issues!<br><br>
        Anyway, good luck and enjoy the ride!`, // preface

        order for yourself. A good tip is to look at the point goal for each Challenge, and save Challenges with higher<br>

        The values of a, b, and c can be set to a nonnegative integer below the cap. To generate QP (by default), you need ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0 to<br>
