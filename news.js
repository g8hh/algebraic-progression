  ["Hello fellow members of the tuba's new place server. Part 1: The past few weeks have seen an unprecedented turmoil amongst various members of the variables community. Some of you may have witnessed the members involved or seen their X Upgrades within the server. With this in mind, I'd like to share that the timewall has been resolved, and solutions have been implemented to help manage Complex Challenge conflicts going forward. I want to extend a sincere thank you to everyone who remained patient with the mod team, Buildings and Functions, as we sought to understand the broken savefile exhaustively, and as we worked tirelessly for two weeks to find a solution to generate Quadratic Power that works. Part 2: With this in mind, the past weeks has been more than extremely taxing on my real time and global speed. I have bought max, respecced Complex Upgrades, softcapped the slope effect and painfully written more news messages. These past two weeks have kept me going Quadratic 20,000,000 times to the point it took a toll on my \"Temporal Ascension\" upgrade effect. I have had to make some very hard decisions to get more CC tiers, weighing the efficiency of Polynomials over the efficiency of Complex Plane currencies. It is with this message that I shall tender my resignation from the Algebraic Progression development team. I cannot be in a capacity where I handle the replies on r/incremental_games; it has grown too much to bear. For the time being I will still manage the \"which AD developer can be the most self-righteous\" tournament; my involvement with Algebraic Progression beyond this is uncertain, but in the future I hope there are more opportunities to host various gwa giveaways so that the experience at tuba's new place is a memorable one.
